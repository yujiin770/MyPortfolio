            <p><strong>Last Updated: November 23, 2023</strong></p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Eugene Almira ("I", "me", or "my") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you visit my portfolio website (the "Site").</p>

            <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
            <p>I collect information in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong> When you use the contact form, I collect the personal information you provide, such as your full name, email address, phone number, and the content of your message. This information is collected solely to respond to your inquiries.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong> To enhance your user experience, my Site uses your browser's `localStorage` to save your theme preference (light or dark mode). This information is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to me or any third party. I do not use tracking cookies or third-party analytics services like Google Analytics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How I Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>The information I collect is used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To communicate with you, respond to your questions, and provide you with information about my services.</li>
                <li>To maintain and improve the Site's functionality and user experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
            <p>I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. However, this does not include trusted third parties who assist me in operating my website, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EmailJS:</strong> My contact form is powered by EmailJS, which processes the data you submit and forwards it to my email address. You can view their privacy policy for more information on how they handle data.</li>
                <li><strong>External Links:</strong> My Site contains links to external sites (like GitHub, YouTube, and social media platforms). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any third-party sites.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>I take reasonable precautions to protect your information. The contact form submissions are transmitted securely. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You have the right to request access to the personal information I hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact me through the form on my portfolio.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
