        <h1>Privacy Policy for History Dash</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 20, 2025</p>

        <p>Team CipherTech is committed to protecting the privacy of our players. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information in our mobile game, History Dash (the "Game").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect minimal information to ensure the Game functions properly and to improve your experience. We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or physical address through the Game.</p>
        <p>The information we collect is limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> This includes your game progress, levels unlocked, high scores in Endless Mode, and quiz results. This data is stored locally on your device or through the HypeHype platform's services and is not personally linked to you by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect non-personal, technical information about your device, such as the device model and operating system version, to help us troubleshoot bugs and optimize the Game for different devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Information:</strong> As the Game is built on the HypeHype platform, HypeHype may collect its own anonymous usage and analytics data. We encourage you to review the HypeHype Privacy Policy for more information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To operate and maintain the Game.</li>
            <li>To improve and personalize your gameplay experience.</li>
            <li>To analyze performance, fix bugs, and develop new features.</li>
            <li>To ensure security and prevent cheating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Anonymous, aggregated data may be shared with our partners (like Tala Tech Games Studio) for analytical purposes. We may also disclose information if required to do so by law.</p>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Game is designed for younger generations. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Game does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. All data collected is anonymous and is used solely for internal operations to support the gameplay experience. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove it.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the Game or on our website. We recommend you review this policy periodically.</p>
